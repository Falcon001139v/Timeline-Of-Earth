            <h3>The Mesozoic Era, known as the Age of Reptiles, is characterized by the dominance of dinosaurs and significant evolutionary developments. It is divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, each marking important phases in Earth's history.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Major Events</h2>
            <p><b>Triassic Period:</b> The Mesozoic Era began with the Triassic, where early dinosaurs emerged after the Permian extinction. This period also saw the first mammals and the evolution of the first true dinosaurs. The climate was generally dry, leading to the development of deserts and arid landscapes.</p>
            <p><b>Jurassic Period:</b> The Jurassic saw the rise of large dinosaurs and the first birds. This period was characterized by lush vegetation, including giant ferns and cycads, and the establishment of the first true mammals. The supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart, leading to increased biodiversity.</p>
            <p><b>Cretaceous Period:</b> The Cretaceous is notable for its rich biodiversity, including flowering plants, which began to dominate the landscape. Dinosaurs continued to evolve into various forms, and the first mammals were small and relatively inconspicuous. The end of this period marked one of the most significant mass extinctions in Earth's history, leading to the demise of many species, including the non-avian dinosaurs.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>The Mesozoic was characterized by generally warm climates, with lush vegetation and diverse ecosystems. Throughout this era, the Earth experienced a greenhouse climate, which contributed to the growth of vast forests and the expansion of marine environments. The warm temperatures allowed for the proliferation of both terrestrial and aquatic life forms.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>The Mesozoic Era is crucial for understanding the evolution of modern species and the ecological transformations that took place. The era laid the foundation for the ecosystems we see today, with the establishment of new plant species and the diversification of animals. The extinction event at the end of this era paved the way for mammals to become the dominant terrestrial vertebrates.</p>

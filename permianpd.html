            <h3>The Permian Period marks the final period of the Paleozoic Era and is notable for its significant geological, climatic, and biological developments. It is characterized by the diversification of life, especially the emergence of reptiles and the dominance of certain plant groups. This period ended with the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, known as the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which drastically changed the planet's biodiversity.</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Geological Features</h2>
            <p>The Permian Period was marked by major geological events, including the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea. This massive landmass resulted in significant changes in sea levels, climate, and habitats.</p>
            <p>During the Permian, the climate varied significantly, with widespread deserts and dry conditions prevailing in many areas. This dry climate led to the development of unique ecosystems that supported various forms of life, including diverse flora and fauna.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
            <p><b>Plant Life:</b> The Permian witnessed the rise of gymnosperms, such as conifers, which became dominant in many terrestrial ecosystems. These plants adapted well to the dry climate, contributing to the formation of extensive forests.</p>
            <p><b>Animal Life:</b> The Permian saw the diversification of amphibians and the rise of early reptiles. Notable groups included the synapsids, ancestors of mammals, which thrived during this period. The end of the Permian also marked the decline of many marine species, but some groups, like ammonites and brachiopods, continued to thrive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mass Extinction</h2>
            <p>The Permian Period ended with a catastrophic mass extinction event around 252 million years ago, often referred to as the Great Dying. It is estimated that about 90-95% of all species became extinct, including many marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
            <p>This extinction was likely caused by a combination of factors, including volcanic activity, climate change, and anoxia in the oceans. The consequences of this event reshaped life on Earth, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs in the subsequent Mesozoic Era.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>The Permian Period is crucial for understanding the evolution of life on Earth. It highlights the resilience and adaptability of organisms in the face of changing environments. The mass extinction event serves as a reminder of the fragility of ecosystems and the impact of drastic environmental changes.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Permian Period played a vital role in shaping the geological and biological landscape of our planet, influencing the course of evolution for millions of years to come.</p>
